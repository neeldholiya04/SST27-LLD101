/*
 * PaymentService does both provider selection and payment logic. Adding a new provider means modifying this class. This is the violation of the Single Responsibility Principle.
 * The switch statement forces modification of PaymentService whenever a new provider is added. This is the violation of the Open/Closed Principle.
 * Payment types are not modeled polymorphically. Thereâ€™s no guarantee that all "payment providers" can be treated interchangeably. This is the violation of the Liskov Substitution Principle.
 * No provider-specific contracts exist. A proper abstraction is missing. This is the violation of the Interface Segregation Principle.
 * PaymentService depends on concrete data (provider string) instead of an abstraction (PaymentProvider). High-level module (PaymentService) depends on low-level details. This is the violation of the Dependency Inversion Principle.
