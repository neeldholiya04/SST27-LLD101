 * OrderService calculates totals, stores orders, and sends emails. Thatâ€™s multiple responsibilities. It violates the Single Responsibility Principle.
 * OrderService is tightly coupled to EmailClient. If we wanted to add SMS or another notifier, we need to modify OrderService. This is the violation of Open/Closed Principle.
 * OrderService depends on a concrete class EmailClient. It should depend on an abstraction. This is the violation of Dependency Inversion Principle.
